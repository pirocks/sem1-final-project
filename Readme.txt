Readme:
en-passant is not implemented because I believe that it is morally wrong/designed to trip up beginners.It is also not present in all versions of chess.
The ai likes to move its top left rook a lot. That's normal.
The ai may sometimes makes odd/losing movs. This is not necesarily a bug. It can be a consequence of insufficient search depth.
